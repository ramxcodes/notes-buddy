Greenhouse Effect – Climate Change and Global Warming
What is the Greenhouse Effect?
The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere trap heat, preventing it from escaping into space, which helps maintain the planet’s temperature suitable for life.
✅ How Does the Greenhouse Effect Work?

Solar Radiation: The Sun emits solar energy that reaches Earth.
Absorption: Some of this energy is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, warming it.
Reflection: Part of the energy is reflected back towards space.
Heat Trapping: Greenhouse gases trap some of the reflected heat, keeping the planet warm.

📝 NOTE: Without the greenhouse effect, Earth’s average temperature would be around -18°C, making it uninhabitable.
