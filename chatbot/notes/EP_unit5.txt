Lasers
What is a Laser?
A Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. It is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. Lasers differ from ordinary light sources in several key aspects, such as their directionality, monochromaticity, coherence, and intensity.
Properties of Lasers
The key properties of lasers are:


Monochromaticity:
Laser light consists of a single wavelength or color. It is coherent in nature, meaning all the light waves are in phase with each other.


Directionality:
Laser light travels in a narrow, well-defined beam, unlike ordinary light that spreads out in all directions.


Coherence:
Laser light exhibits temporal coherence, meaning the light waves have a constant phase relationship over time. It also exhibits spatial coherence, meaning the light waves remain in phase over a large distance.


High Intensity:
The intensity of a laser beam is much higher than ordinary light due to the concentration of photons in a small area.


Polarization:
Laser light can be easily polarized in a specific direction, unlike ordinary light.


Spontaneous and Stimulated Emission of Radiation
Spontaneous Emission:

Spontaneous emission occurs when an electron in a higher energy level in an atom or molecule drops to a lower energy level without any external influence.
During this transition, energy is released in the form of a photon.
The emitted photon has a random phase and direction, and this type of emission is generally weak.

Stimulated Emission:

Stimulated emission occurs when an electron in a higher energy state is already in the presence of a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between two states.
The incident photon stimulates the electron to drop to a lower energy level, emitting a second photon that is coherent with the incident photon (same frequency, phase, direction, and polarization).
Stimulated emission is the fundamental process behind laser action.

Einstein’s A & B Coefficients:

The relationship between spontaneous and stimulated emission is quantified by Einstein’s coefficients:

A (spontaneous emission coefficient) describes the probability of an electron transitioning to a lower energy state by spontaneous emission.
B (stimulated emission coefficient) describes the probability of an electron transitioning to a lower energy state due to the presence of an external photon.



Formula for Stimulated Emission:
I=B⋅N⋅ρI = B \cdot N \cdot \rhoI=B⋅N⋅ρ
Where:

III = intensity of the emitted radiation
NNN = number of atoms or molecules in the excited state
ρ\rhoρ = energy density of the incident radiation
BBB = Einstein’s coefficient for stimulated emission

Population Inversion

For laser action to occur, population inversion is required. Normally, more particles (atoms or molecules) reside in lower energy states than higher ones (this is known as thermal equilibrium).
In population inversion, more particles must be in a higher energy state than in a lower one. This inversion is essential to ensure that stimulated emission dominates over absorption, leading to laser light generation.


Einstein’s A & B Coefficients
Introduction
Einstein’s A and B coefficients describe the rates of spontaneous and stimulated emission of radiation in atoms and molecules. These coefficients were introduced by Albert Einstein to explain the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of light emission, especially in laser systems.
The Coefficients


A Coefficient (Spontaneous Emission):

The A coefficient defines the probability of spontaneous emission. It determines the rate at which an atom or molecule in an excited state decays to a lower energy state by emitting a photon.
This process occurs without external influence and leads to the emission of a photon in a random direction.
The A coefficient has units of s−1\text{s}^{-1}s−1, indicating the rate of emission.



B Coefficient (Stimulated Emission and Absorption):

The B coefficient relates to the probability that an atom or molecule in an excited state will undergo stimulated emission (emitting a photon due to interaction with an external photon) or absorption (transitioning to an excited state due to external radiation).
The B coefficient is split into two types:

B12B_{12}B12​: Coefficient for stimulated emission from higher energy state (state 2) to lower energy state (state 1).
B21B_{21}B21​: Coefficient for stimulated absorption from state 1 to state 2.





Relationship Between A and B Coefficients
Einstein showed that the coefficients for absorption and stimulated emission are related through the frequency of radiation (ν\nuν):
B21B12=ν38π\frac{B_{21}}{B_{12}} = \frac{\nu^3}{8 \pi}B12​B21​​=8πν3​
Additionally, the A coefficient and B coefficient are related by the equation:
A21=8πhν3c3B21A_{21} = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^3} B_{21}A21​=c38πhν3​B21​
Where:

hhh is Planck’s constant,
ν\nuν is the frequency of the radiation,
ccc is the speed of light.

This relationship ensures that the processes of absorption and emission are balanced according to the energy of the radiation.
Significance in Lasers

Stimulated Emission: A large B coefficient for stimulated emission is essential for the efficient production of coherent light in lasers.
Spontaneous Emission: While spontaneous emission is important, it is less efficient compared to stimulated emission for laser operation.
Laser Efficiency: By understanding the A and B coefficients, laser systems can be optimized for maximum efficiency, particularly by promoting stimulated emission over spontaneous emission.


Population Inversion
What is Population Inversion?
Population inversion is a key condition required for the operation of lasers. It refers to the situation where more atoms or molecules in a material are in an excited state than in a lower energy state, contrary to the natural tendency of systems in thermal equilibrium where lower energy states are more populated.
In normal conditions, the majority of particles are in their ground or lower energy states. However, for lasers to function, there needs to be a greater number of particles in an excited state than in the ground state. This is called population inversion.
Importance of Population Inversion in Lasers
Population inversion is necessary for stimulated emission to dominate over absorption. When the number of particles in the higher energy state exceeds those in the lower energy state, any incoming photon will more likely stimulate the emission of another photon from a particle in the excited state, leading to laser action.
Without population inversion, spontaneous emission (which is random) will dominate, and the laser will not function efficiently.
How is Population Inversion Achieved?
Population inversion is typically achieved by using an external source of energy (often called the pumping mechanism) to excite the atoms or molecules in a laser medium. This energy can be supplied through several methods:

Optical Pumping: Using light to excite the atoms or molecules to a higher energy state.
Electrical Pumping: Using an electric current to excite the atoms, often used in gas lasers like the He-Ne laser.
Chemical Pumping: Using chemical reactions to generate excited states.
Mechanical Pumping: Using mechanical work, such as in some types of solid-state lasers.

Types of Population Inversion


Inversion in Semiconductors: Achieved in semiconductor lasers (also known as diode lasers) by applying a voltage that excites electrons and holes, creating a population inversion in the conduction band.


Inversion in Gas Lasers: In gas lasers like He-Ne lasers, population inversion is achieved by applying electrical energy that excites the gas atoms into a higher energy state.


Inversion in Solid-State Lasers: In ruby lasers and other solid-state lasers, optical or electrical pumping is used to excite atoms in a crystal matrix, creating a population inversion.


Process of Population Inversion
The process of achieving population inversion can be broken down into the following steps:

Pumping: External energy (light, electricity, or chemicals) excites atoms or molecules to a higher energy state.
Excited State: The atoms or molecules reach a higher energy state and remain in this state for a short period of time.
Inversion: A sufficient number of particles are in the excited state, creating a situation where more particles are in the excited state than in the ground state.
Laser Action: Once population inversion is achieved, stimulated emission dominates, leading to coherent light being emitted as photons are released from excited particles.

Challenges in Achieving Population Inversion

Pump Efficiency: The efficiency of the pumping process must be high enough to overcome losses such as spontaneous emission.
Lasing Medium: The medium used (whether gas, liquid, or solid) must have appropriate energy levels that allow for population inversion.
Lifetime of Excited States: The higher energy states must have a relatively long lifetime to allow for inversion to be sustained.

Example of Population Inversion
In a Ruby Laser, the population inversion is achieved by optical pumping with a flashlamp. The flashlamp excites the chromium ions in the ruby crystal, causing them to move to a higher energy state. Once inversion is achieved, these ions can then undergo stimulated emission, producing coherent laser light.

Components of a Laser
A laser consists of three essential components that work together to produce coherent light: the laser medium, the pump source, and the optical resonator (also known as the laser cavity). These components collaborate to achieve and sustain population inversion and ensure that the emitted light is coherent, monochromatic, and directed in a narrow beam.
1. Laser Medium (Active Medium)
The laser medium is the material that is excited to a higher energy state to produce the laser light. It can be in the form of gas, liquid, or solid, and it determines the type of laser being used.
Types of Laser Media:


Gas Lasers:

Examples: Helium-Neon (He-Ne) Laser, CO₂ Laser.
In these lasers, the active medium is a gas or a mixture of gases. When an electric current is passed through the gas, the atoms or molecules are excited and undergo stimulated emission.



Solid-State Lasers:

Examples: Ruby Laser, YAG Laser.
The active medium is a solid crystal or glass that contains doping elements (e.g., chromium ions in ruby or neodymium ions in YAG). These materials are optically pumped to produce population inversion.



Diode Lasers (Semiconductor Lasers):

Examples: Laser Diodes.
The active medium is a semiconductor material, often made from a combination of elements like gallium, arsenide, and phosphorus. Diode lasers are typically pumped electrically.



Dye Lasers:

In these lasers, the active medium is a liquid dye that is pumped with light. Dye lasers are tunable, meaning their output wavelength can be adjusted over a broad range.



2. Pump Source
The pump source provides the necessary energy to excite the atoms or molecules in the laser medium to a higher energy state, enabling the population inversion required for laser action.
Types of Pump Sources:


Optical Pumping: Light from an external source, such as a flashlamp or another laser, is used to excite the atoms or molecules in the laser medium.

Example: In ruby lasers, a flashlamp is used to optically pump the ruby crystal.



Electrical Pumping: In gas lasers and semiconductor lasers, electrical energy is used to excite the atoms or electrons, respectively, in the laser medium.

Example: He-Ne lasers use electrical discharge to excite the gas atoms.



Chemical Pumping: Chemical reactions release energy to excite the laser medium. This type of pumping is used in some chemical lasers.

Example: In chemical lasers, chemical reactions provide the excitation energy.



3. Optical Resonator (Laser Cavity)
The optical resonator is a pair of mirrors placed at each end of the laser medium. Its purpose is to reflect the photons back and forth through the laser medium, stimulating further emissions and ensuring that the light produced is coherent and focused into a narrow beam.
Key Features of the Optical Resonator:


Two Mirrors:

One mirror is fully reflective, while the other is partially reflective. The partially reflective mirror allows some of the light to escape as the laser output.
The fully reflective mirror reflects all of the light back through the laser medium to promote further stimulated emission.



Resonance Condition:

The distance between the two mirrors must be carefully chosen so that the photons reflect in phase, thus reinforcing the light and increasing its intensity. This ensures that only light of a specific wavelength is amplified, maintaining the monochromaticity of the laser beam.



Laser Beam Formation:

The light that escapes through the partially reflective mirror is the laser beam. It is coherent (all waves are in phase) and highly directional.



4. Output Coupler
The output coupler is the partially reflective mirror that allows the amplified light to escape from the optical resonator as a narrow, coherent laser beam. The amount of light transmitted through the output coupler determines the power and intensity of the laser beam.

Ruby Laser
Introduction to Ruby Laser
The Ruby Laser is one of the first types of lasers ever developed and is a solid-state laser. It uses a ruby crystal (a form of corundum with chromium ions) as the laser medium. The ruby laser was invented by Theodore Maiman in 1960 and is a famous example of an optical pump laser. The laser’s output is a red beam of light with a wavelength of approximately 694.3 nm.
Components of a Ruby Laser
The Ruby Laser consists of the following main components:


Laser Medium (Active Medium):

The laser medium is a ruby crystal, which is made of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) with a small amount of chromium (Cr³⁺) ions that are responsible for the laser’s emission.
The chromium ions are the active species in the ruby crystal, and they are excited to higher energy levels by external energy input.



Pump Source:

The pump source is typically a flashlamp that emits high-intensity light. The flashlamp surrounds the ruby crystal and excites the chromium ions within it.
The light from the flashlamp is absorbed by the chromium ions, promoting them from a lower energy state to an excited state.



Optical Resonator (Laser Cavity):

The ruby crystal is placed inside a cylindrical cavity with two mirrors at both ends.
One mirror is fully reflective, while the other is partially reflective (output coupler) to allow the laser light to exit as a coherent beam.



How the Ruby Laser Works


Excitation of Chromium Ions:

The flashlamp provides the external energy, exciting the chromium ions in the ruby crystal to a higher energy level.
The electrons in the chromium ions absorb the energy and jump to an excited state.



Spontaneous Emission:

Some of the excited chromium ions will undergo spontaneous emission, releasing photons of light in a random direction. However, this emission is not sufficient to create coherent light.



Stimulated Emission:

The key to laser action in the ruby laser is stimulated emission. When the excited chromium ions are in the presence of photons with the same energy, they are stimulated to drop to a lower energy state, emitting a photon that is coherent with the incoming photon (same frequency, phase, and direction).



Optical Cavity and Resonance:

The photons travel back and forth between the two mirrors in the optical cavity. Each time a photon passes through the ruby crystal, it stimulates more emissions of coherent photons, amplifying the light.
The light builds up in intensity as it bounces between the mirrors. Eventually, the light escapes through the partially reflective mirror, forming the laser beam.



Laser Output:

The output of the ruby laser is a narrow, intense red beam of light with a wavelength of 694.3 nm. This is the result of the stimulated emission of photons from the chromium ions in the ruby crystal.



Ruby Laser Characteristics

Wavelength: The ruby laser produces a red beam with a wavelength of 694.3 nm.
Pulse Laser: The ruby laser typically operates in pulsed mode. It releases light in short bursts, which is a result of the pumping process.

He-Ne Laser
Introduction to He-Ne Laser
The Helium-Neon (He-Ne) Laser is one of the most widely used types of gas lasers, known for its simplicity, reliability, and ability to produce a coherent beam of red light. The He-Ne laser was invented in 1961 by Ali Javan, and it uses a mixture of helium (He) and neon (Ne) gases as the laser medium. This laser is most commonly found in research, medical, and industrial applications due to its low cost, ease of use, and stable operation.
Components of a He-Ne Laser
The He-Ne laser consists of the following key components:


Laser Medium (Active Medium):

The laser medium in a He-Ne laser is a mixture of helium (He) and neon (Ne) gases, typically at low pressure.
The helium atoms are used to excite the neon atoms to a higher energy state through a process called collisional excitation.
The neon atoms are the active species responsible for laser emission. When they transition from an excited state to a lower energy state, they emit photons, creating the laser light.



Pump Source:

The pump source is an electrical discharge that excites the helium atoms in the gas mixture.
The electrical discharge creates a plasma, where electrons collide with helium atoms, exciting them to higher energy levels.
These excited helium atoms then transfer their energy to the neon atoms, promoting them to higher energy levels.



Optical Resonator (Laser Cavity):

The optical resonator consists of two mirrors placed at either end of the laser tube. One of these mirrors is fully reflective, and the other is partially reflective to allow the laser beam to exit.
The mirrors reflect the photons back and forth through the gas mixture, stimulating further emissions and amplifying the light.



Output Coupler:

The output coupler is the partially reflective mirror through which the coherent laser light exits. It is designed to transmit only a small fraction of the light to maintain high intensity inside the resonator while allowing a portion of the light to escape as the laser beam.



How the He-Ne Laser Works


Excitation of Helium Atoms:

The electrical discharge in the gas mixture excites the helium atoms to higher energy levels. The helium atoms are primarily excited to the 2³S₁ state.



Energy Transfer to Neon Atoms:

The excited helium atoms transfer their energy to the neon atoms through collisional excitation. The energy transfer is highly efficient, and this step leads to the excitation of neon atoms to a higher energy state.



Population Inversion:

Neon atoms are excited to the 5³P₂ and 5³P₁ energy levels. However, to achieve population inversion, a greater number of neon atoms must be in these excited states than in the ground state.



Stimulated Emission:

Once population inversion is achieved, the excited neon atoms undergo stimulated emission, emitting photons of light as they transition to a lower energy state.
These emitted photons are coherent, meaning they have the same frequency, phase, and direction.



Optical Resonator:

The photons are reflected back and forth within the optical cavity, stimulating further emissions and increasing the intensity of the light.
Eventually, the coherent photons exit through the partially reflective mirror, forming the laser beam.



Laser Output:

The He-Ne laser typically produces a continuous output of red light with a wavelength of 632.8 nm. This wavelength is in the visible red region of the electromagnetic spectrum.



Characteristics of He-Ne Laser

Wavelength: The primary output wavelength of the He-Ne laser is 632.8 nm (red light), but it can also produce other wavelengths (e.g., 1153.2 nm, 543.5 nm) in infrared and green regions, depending on the specific transitions in the neon atoms.
Power Output: He-Ne lasers typically produce power outputs in the range of 1–100 mW, making them suitable for a wide range of applications requiring low to moderate power.
Coherent Light: The output of a He-Ne laser is highly coherent, which is a key property for its use in precision applications.
Continuous Wave (CW): The He-Ne laser usually operates in continuous wave mode, meaning it provides a constant, uninterrupted beam of light.

Fiber Optics: Fundamental Idea About Optical Fibre and Propagation of Light
What is Optical Fibre?
Optical fibre is a thin, flexible strand of glass or plastic that is used to transmit light signals. It operates based on the principle of total internal reflection, which allows light to travel through the fibre, even when it bends, by repeatedly reflecting off the walls of the fibre core. Optical fibres are primarily used in telecommunications, internet data transmission, and medical applications such as endoscopy.
Structure of Optical Fibre
An optical fibre consists of three main parts:


Core:

The central part of the optical fibre, where the light travels. It is made of a material (usually glass or plastic) that has a higher refractive index than the surrounding cladding.



Cladding:

Surrounding the core, the cladding is made of a material with a lower refractive index than the core. The cladding ensures that light remains within the core by reflecting it back into the core using total internal reflection.



Protective Coating:

The outer layer of the optical fibre, which protects the core and cladding from physical damage and environmental factors like moisture or abrasion. It also helps to insulate the fibre.



Propagation of Light Through Optical Fibre
The propagation of light through an optical fibre is based on the principle of total internal reflection. This process ensures that the light continues to travel along the fibre core with minimal loss.
Total Internal Reflection:


Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (the core) to a medium with a lower refractive index (the cladding) at an angle greater than the critical angle. This angle is the minimum angle at which light, moving from the denser medium (core) to the less dense medium (cladding), will be totally reflected inside the core rather than refracting out.


The critical angle θc\theta_cθc​ is given by the formula:
θc=sin⁡−1(n2n1)\theta_c = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)θc​=sin−1(n1​n2​​)
Where:

n1n_1n1​ is the refractive index of the core.
n2n_2n2​ is the refractive index of the cladding.
The angle of incidence must be greater than θc\theta_cθc​ for total internal reflection to occur.



Once total internal reflection happens, the light will continue to propagate down the fibre, reflecting off the core-cladding interface. This allows the light to travel long distances with minimal loss.
Acceptance Angle
The acceptance angle is the maximum angle at which light can enter the optical fibre and still be guided through the fibre core. If the angle of incidence is too large, light will not be fully confined to the core and may escape into the cladding or even outside the fibre.
Numerical Aperture (NA) and Acceptance Angle:
The Numerical Aperture (NA) of an optical fibre is a measure of the light-gathering ability of the fibre. It determines the range of angles over which the fibre can accept light. The larger the NA, the greater the acceptance angle.
The relationship between the numerical aperture (NA) and the acceptance angle θ0\theta_0θ0​ is given by the following equation:
NA=sin⁡(θ0)\text{NA} = \sin(\theta_0)NA=sin(θ0​)
Where:

NA is the numerical aperture.
θ0\theta_0θ0​ is the acceptance angle.

The numerical aperture can also be expressed in terms of the refractive indices of the core and cladding:
NA=n12−n22\text{NA} = \sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}NA=n12​−n22​​
Where:

n1n_1n1​ is the refractive index of the core.
n2n_2n2​ is the refractive index of the cladding.

Propagation Modes in Optical Fibre
Optical fibres can support two types of modes depending on their core diameter and the wavelength of light:


Single-mode Fibre:

In single-mode fibre, the core diameter is small enough to allow only one mode of light to propagate, typically in a straight path.
This type of fibre is used for long-distance transmission due to its low loss and high bandwidth.



Multimode Fibre:

In multimode fibre, the core is larger, allowing multiple modes of light to propagate through the fibre. These modes travel at different speeds, causing some light to arrive at the end of the fibre at a later time than other light.
Multimode fibres are typically used for shorter-distance transmissions due to higher dispersion.



Engineering Applications of Optical Fibres


Telecommunications:

Optical fibres are the backbone of modern communication systems, transmitting vast amounts of data over long distances at high speed with minimal signal loss and electromagnetic interference.



Medical Endoscopy:

Optical fibres are used in medical endoscopes to visualize the internal organs of a patient, as they can be inserted into the body via small incisions or natural body openings.



Networking:

Fibre-optic cables are used in local area networks (LANs) and data centres for high-speed internet and data transmission.



Sensing and Monitoring:

Optical fibres are used in distributed fibre-optic sensing for applications such as temperature, pressure, and strain measurements, commonly used in industrial monitoring, civil engineering (e.g., structural health monitoring), and environmental monitoring.



Lighting and Illumination:

Optical fibres are used in decorative lighting, signage, and architectural lighting due to their ability to carry light over long distances.




Numerical Aperture and Fractional Refractive Index Change
Numerical Aperture (NA)
The Numerical Aperture (NA) of an optical fibre is a key parameter that determines the light-gathering ability and the acceptance angle of the fibre. It describes the range of angles over which the fibre can accept and transmit light. The larger the NA, the greater the amount of light that can be accepted and transmitted through the fibre.
Formula for Numerical Aperture:
The numerical aperture of an optical fibre is given by the equation:
NA=sin⁡(θ0)\text{NA} = \sin(\theta_0)NA=sin(θ0​)
Where:

θ0\theta_0θ0​ is the acceptance angle, the maximum angle at which light can enter the fibre and still be guided through the core.

Alternatively, the NA can be related to the refractive indices of the core and cladding of the fibre:
NA=n12−n22\text{NA} = \sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}NA=n12​−n22​​
Where:

n1n_1n1​ is the refractive index of the core of the fibre.
n2n_2n2​ is the refractive index of the cladding of the fibre.

Key Points:

The higher the NA, the greater the acceptance angle and the more light the fibre can capture.
NA is an important factor in determining the light transmission capacity and the bandwidth of the optical fibre.
Single-mode fibres generally have lower NA values, while multimode fibres have higher NA values, allowing them to accept more light.

Fractional Refractive Index Change
The fractional refractive index change (Δ\DeltaΔ) is another important parameter that quantifies the difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding of an optical fibre.
Formula for Fractional Refractive Index Change:
The fractional refractive index change is given by:
Δ=n1−n2n1\Delta = \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1}Δ=n1​n1​−n2​​
Where:

n1n_1n1​ is the refractive index of the core.
n2n_2n2​ is the refractive index of the cladding.

Significance of Fractional Refractive Index Change:

The fractional refractive index change represents how much the refractive index of the core differs from that of the cladding as a percentage of the refractive index of the core.
A larger value of Δ\DeltaΔ means a greater refractive index difference between the core and cladding, which leads to a higher numerical aperture (NA), improving the fibre’s ability to accept light.
A smaller value of Δ\DeltaΔ indicates a narrower refractive index difference, which results in lower NA and thus less light transmission capability.

Relationship Between NA and Fractional Refractive Index Change
The numerical aperture is related to the fractional refractive index change through the following equation:
NA=2Δ\text{NA} = \sqrt{2\Delta}NA=2Δ​
This formula highlights that the numerical aperture is directly affected by the fractional refractive index change. Therefore, increasing the fractional refractive index change between the core and cladding increases the NA, which enhances the fibre’s ability to gather light.
Impact of Numerical Aperture and Fractional Refractive Index Change on Fibre Performance


Light-Gathering Ability:

A larger NA (due to a larger fractional refractive index change) allows the optical fibre to gather light over a wider range of angles. This is particularly beneficial in multimode fibres, where light from multiple paths is guided simultaneously.



Mode Propagation:

In multimode fibres, a higher NA leads to a greater number of light modes being supported. However, higher NA can also increase modal dispersion, which can affect the fibre’s bandwidth and signal clarity.
Single-mode fibres, with a lower NA, support only one mode of light, ensuring better performance over long distances with minimal signal degradation.



Bending Loss:

Fibres with high NA tend to be more sensitive to bending. If the fibre is bent too much, light may escape from the core and be lost. On the other hand, fibres with lower NA are more resistant to bending losses.



Bandwidth:

The NA and fractional refractive index change also influence the bandwidth of the fibre. Fibres with a larger NA may have reduced bandwidth over long distances due to greater modal dispersion, which causes light modes to travel at different speeds.



Summary

Numerical Aperture (NA) determines how much light an optical fibre can accept and guide. It is crucial for both the light transmission efficiency and the propagation characteristics of the fibre.
Fractional refractive index change quantifies the difference in refractive indices between the core and cladding and directly influences the fibre’s NA.
Higher NA generally leads to better light-gathering ability but may reduce performance in terms of bandwidth and modal dispersion.


Classification of Optical Fibres and V Number
Classification of Optical Fibres
Optical fibres are classified based on two key characteristics: the number of modes they support and the refractive index profile of the core and cladding. The classifications help in determining the fibre’s performance in various applications such as telecommunications, data transmission, and medical systems.
1. Based on Mode of Propagation
Optical fibres are classified as either single-mode fibres or multimode fibres, depending on the number of light modes they support.
Single-Mode Fibre (SMF):

Definition: Single-mode fibres are designed to carry only one mode of light (the fundamental mode), which travels in a straight line along the fibre’s length.
Core Diameter: Typically ranges from 8 µm to 10 µm, which is very small to limit the light to one path.
Applications: They are used for long-distance communication, high-speed internet, and high-bandwidth applications, due to their ability to maintain signal integrity over long distances.
Advantages:

Minimal signal loss and dispersion, allowing for high data rates and longer transmission distances.


Disadvantages:

More expensive than multimode fibres, and their installation is more complex.



Multimode Fibre (MMF):

Definition: Multimode fibres have larger core diameters that allow light to propagate in multiple paths or modes. The different modes of light travel at different speeds, causing some dispersion.
Core Diameter: Typically ranges from 50 µm to 100 µm.
Applications: Used for short-distance transmission, such as in local area networks (LANs), data centres, and within buildings.
Advantages:

Easier to install and align, with lower cost compared to single-mode fibres.


Disadvantages:

Higher signal loss and dispersion, limiting their effectiveness over long distances.



2. Based on Refractive Index Profile
Optical fibres can also be classified based on the refractive index distribution across the core and cladding.
Step-Index Fibre:

Definition: In step-index fibres, the refractive index of the core is uniform and constant, and there is a sharp change (or “step”) between the core and the cladding.
Advantages: Simple to fabricate, cost-effective.
Disadvantages: Causes modal dispersion, as light modes travel at different speeds.

Graded-Index Fibre:

Definition: In graded-index fibres, the refractive index gradually decreases from the centre of the core to the edge. This gradient helps in minimizing modal dispersion, allowing for better performance over longer distances.
Advantages: Reduced modal dispersion compared to step-index fibres.
Disadvantages: More complex to manufacture, more expensive.


V Number (Normalized Frequency)
The V Number, also known as the normalized frequency or normalised propagation constant, is a crucial parameter that describes the mode structure of an optical fibre and helps determine the number of modes the fibre can support. It depends on the wavelength of light, the radius of the core, and the refractive indices of the core and cladding.
Formula for V Number:
The V number is calculated using the following formula:
V=2πaλ⋅NAV = \frac{2 \pi a}{\lambda} \cdot \text{NA}V=λ2πa​⋅NA
Where:

VVV = V number (normalized frequency).
aaa = Radius of the core of the fibre.
λ\lambdaλ = Wavelength of light.
NA = Numerical aperture of the fibre.

Alternatively, it can also be expressed as:
V=2πaλn12−n22V = \frac{2 \pi a}{\lambda} \sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}V=λ2πa​n12​−n22​​
Where:

n1n_1n1​ = Refractive index of the core.
n2n_2n2​ = Refractive index of the cladding.

Significance of the V Number:


The V number helps determine how many modes the optical fibre can support:

For single-mode fibre, V<2.405V < 2.405V<2.405.
For multimode fibre, V>2.405V > 2.405V>2.405, and the fibre can support multiple propagation modes.



V < 2.405 (Single-Mode):

When the V number is less than 2.405, the fibre supports only the fundamental mode, making it a single-mode fibre. Single-mode fibres have minimal dispersion, which makes them ideal for long-distance communication and high-bandwidth applications.



V > 2.405 (Multimode):

When the V number is greater than 2.405, the fibre can support multiple modes of light propagation, and it is classified as a multimode fibre. The light travels through the fibre in different paths, causing modal dispersion, which limits the bandwidth over long distances.



V Number and Core Radius:

For a fixed wavelength and refractive index, the V number increases as the core radius increases, allowing the fibre to support more modes. This is characteristic of multimode fibres, which can handle a larger number of modes.



Applications of V Number:

The V number is used in the design of optical fibres to choose the appropriate fibre type (single-mode or multimode) based on the transmission distance, data rate, and the specific application.
It helps predict the modal behaviour of the fibre, including the number of modes that can be supported and the impact on signal quality and bandwidth.


Summary of Classification and V Number:

Classification of optical fibres can be done based on:

Mode of propagation (single-mode vs. multimode).
Refractive index profile (step-index vs. graded-index).


V Number is a key parameter that defines the number of modes an optical fibre can support. It is critical for selecting the appropriate fibre for a given application, especially in terms of data transmission distances and bandwidth requirements.
