## Construction of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)

### Introduction to Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)

The **Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)** is a device used for displaying images, waveforms, or other visual data. It is most commonly known for its use in older television sets, computer monitors, and oscilloscopes. The CRT operates by firing a stream of electrons (electron beam) onto a phosphorescent screen to create a visible image. Despite being largely replaced by more modern technologies like **LCD** and **LED** displays, CRTs still have an important role in specific applications, such as **oscilloscopes** (for signal display) and **legacy equipment**.

A CRT consists of multiple key components that work together to produce the electron beam, deflect it, and display images or waveforms on a screen.

---

### 1. **Basic Components of CRT**

The CRT is constructed from several components that work in tandem to create the display:

#### 1.1 **Electron Gun**

The **electron gun** is located at the rear of the CRT and is responsible for generating and directing the electron beam toward the phosphorescent screen. The electron gun consists of three main parts:
- **Cathode**: A heated filament that emits electrons. It is negatively charged and heats up to release electrons due to thermionic emission.
- **Wehnelt Cylinder**: A metal electrode that controls the flow of electrons from the cathode. It helps focus the electron beam into a fine, narrow stream.
- **Anode**: A positively charged electrode that accelerates the electrons. As the electrons pass through the anode, they gain speed and energy, preparing them for display on the screen.

#### 1.2 **Phosphorescent Screen**

The **phosphorescent screen** is the part of the CRT that emits visible light when struck by electrons. The screen is coated with a layer of phosphor, a substance that glows when it is excited by electrons. The intensity of the light produced is proportional to the number of electrons striking the phosphor. The screen is divided into small pixels or spots, and the electron beam is directed to different locations on the screen to create the image.

- **Phosphor Coating**: The phosphor coating on the screen is made up of special materials that glow when struck by an electron. In color CRTs, three phosphor colors (red, green, and blue) are arranged in patterns to create full-color images.

#### 1.3 **Deflection System**

The **deflection system** controls the movement of the electron beam across the phosphorescent screen. This is typically done using either **magnetic deflection** (in older CRTs) or **electrostatic deflection** (in oscilloscopes and modern CRTs).

- **Magnetic Deflection**: Magnetic fields are created by coils placed around the CRT, and these magnetic fields cause the electron beam to deflect in both the **horizontal** and **vertical** directions. The movement of the beam is controlled by changing the strength and direction of the magnetic field.
- **Electrostatic Deflection**: In electrostatic deflection, two pairs of deflection plates (vertical and horizontal) are used. The deflection plates are charged with varying electric potentials, causing the electron beam to bend towards the desired position on the screen.

#### 1.4 **Glass Envelope (Vacuum Tube)**

The entire CRT is housed in a **glass envelope**, which is a vacuum tube that encloses the components of the CRT, including the electron gun and the phosphorescent screen. The vacuum inside the tube ensures that electrons travel freely without colliding with air molecules, which would otherwise scatter the electrons and reduce the intensity of the display.

- **Vacuum**: The electron gun requires a vacuum to operate effectively, as it allows electrons to travel in a straight line without interference from air molecules. The vacuum also protects the internal components from oxidation and contamination.

#### 1.5 **Accelerating Anode**

After the electrons are emitted from the cathode, they pass through the **accelerating anode**. The accelerating anode is a positively charged electrode that increases the velocity of the electrons. This step is essential to give the electrons enough energy to strike the phosphorescent screen and produce visible light. The electrons need to be traveling at a high speed to excite the phosphor material effectively.

---

### 2. **Working of a CRT**

The operation of a CRT involves several key stages, from electron emission to the final display on the screen:

#### 2.1 **Electron Emission**

The cathode (filament) in the electron gun is heated, causing it to emit electrons through the process of **thermionic emission**. These electrons are negatively charged and are accelerated by the electric field created by the anode.

#### 2.2 **Electron Beam Formation**

The **Wehnelt cylinder** focuses the emitted electrons into a narrow, fine beam. The beam is then accelerated by the positively charged **anode** and directed toward the screen. The high speed and energy of the electron beam are required to excite the phosphorescent material on the screen.

#### 2.3 **Beam Deflection**

The deflection system (either magnetic or electrostatic) manipulates the direction of the electron beam, allowing it to travel across the screen and create a visible pattern. The beam moves horizontally from left to right and vertically from top to bottom.

- **Horizontal Deflection**: The electron beam sweeps across the screen from left to right, typically synchronized with the signal's time base in oscilloscopes or video signals in TVs.
- **Vertical Deflection**: The electron beam is moved vertically based on the input signal's amplitude. In a typical display, the height of the beam corresponds to the signal's intensity or brightness.

#### 2.4 **Phosphorescent Screen Glow**

When the electron beam strikes the **phosphorescent screen**, it excites the phosphor particles, causing them to emit light. This light is what forms the visible image or waveform on the screen. The intensity of the light is determined by the number of electrons hitting each spot on the screen, which is controlled by the input signal (for oscilloscopes) or video signals (for TVs).

---

### 3. **Applications of CRTs**

While CRTs are no longer used in modern televisions and monitors, they are still relevant in specific applications:

#### 3.1 **Oscilloscopes**

The **Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)** is a common application of the CRT. In oscilloscopes, the CRT is used to display electrical waveforms, showing the variation of voltage over time. This allows engineers and scientists to visualize and analyze signals from electronic circuits.

#### 3.2 **Radar Systems**

CRTs are used in radar systems to display the distance and velocity of objects by reflecting radio waves. The electron beam displays the position of objects on the screen based on the time taken for the radar signals to return.

#### 3.3 **Cathode Ray Tubes in Legacy Devices**

Older television sets and computer monitors used CRT technology to display images. Although these devices have been largely replaced by newer flat-panel display technologies like **LCD** and **LED**, CRTs are still used in specialized equipment like older medical imaging devices and laboratory test equipment.

---

### 4. **Advantages of CRT**

---

### 6. **Conclusion**

The **Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)** is a classic technology used to display electronic signals and images. While modern technologies like **LCD**, **LED**, and **OLED** displays have replaced CRTs in most consumer applications, CRTs are still useful in specialized applications like oscilloscopes, radar systems, and legacy devices. The CRT operates by generating and directing an electron beam onto a phosphorescent screen, where it creates visible light in the form of images or waveforms.

## Deflection Sensitivity and Various Controls in CRT

### Introduction to Deflection Sensitivity

In the context of a **Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)**, **deflection sensitivity** refers to the ability of the CRT to move the electron beam across the screen in response to an input signal. The deflection sensitivity determines how much the electron beam will move for a given amount of input voltage, which is critical for achieving accurate measurements or proper visualization of signals on the screen.

There are two main types of deflection in a CRT:
1. **Vertical Deflection**: Controls the upward and downward movement of the electron beam in response to the input signal's voltage.
2. **Horizontal Deflection**: Controls the left and right movement of the electron beam, typically synchronized with the time base or signal frequency.

The deflection sensitivity of a CRT is determined by the amount of voltage applied to the deflection plates or magnetic coils for a given movement of the electron beam. Higher deflection sensitivity results in more movement of the beam for a given voltage.

---

### 1. **Vertical Deflection Sensitivity**

Vertical deflection sensitivity is the relationship between the input signal's voltage and the vertical displacement of the electron beam on the CRT screen. In other words, it tells you how much the beam will move vertically for each unit of voltage in the input signal.

#### Formula for Vertical Deflection Sensitivity:
The vertical deflection sensitivity (S) can be calculated as:

**S = (Vertical Deflection / Input Voltage)**

Where:
- **Vertical Deflection**: The vertical displacement of the beam on the screen, typically measured in centimeters or millimeters.
- **Input Voltage**: The voltage applied to the vertical deflection plates in response to the signal.

The vertical deflection sensitivity is typically controlled using the **vertical amplifier**, which amplifies the input signal to a level suitable for driving the electron beam.

#### Factors Affecting Vertical Deflection Sensitivity:
- **Amplitude of Input Signal**: The higher the amplitude of the signal, the greater the deflection.
- **Voltage Gain of the Vertical Amplifier**: The gain controls how much the input signal is amplified, affecting the deflection.
- **Deflection Plate Geometry**: The shape and size of the deflection plates influence the degree of deflection.

---

### 2. **Horizontal Deflection Sensitivity**

Horizontal deflection sensitivity refers to the amount of horizontal movement of the electron beam for each unit of time. The horizontal deflection is primarily controlled by the **time base** (or sweep generator), which dictates how the beam moves from left to right across the screen.

#### Formula for Horizontal Deflection Sensitivity:
The horizontal deflection sensitivity (Sh) can be calculated as:

**Sh = (Horizontal Deflection / Time Interval)**

Where:
- **Horizontal Deflection**: The horizontal displacement of the beam on the screen.
- **Time Interval**: The period or time taken for the beam to travel across the screen, which is determined by the time base.

The **time base generator** is responsible for controlling the horizontal sweep rate of the electron beam, dictating how fast the beam moves horizontally.

#### Factors Affecting Horizontal Deflection Sensitivity:
- **Frequency of the Time Base**: The frequency at which the time base operates directly affects the horizontal deflection sensitivity.
- **Sweep Rate**: The sweep rate controls how fast the electron beam moves horizontally across the screen, which can be adjusted to display signals at different time scales.
- **Horizontal Amplifier Gain**: The gain of the horizontal amplifier determines how much the horizontal deflection will respond to the time base.

---

### 3. **Vertical and Horizontal Sensitivity Controls**

In a typical **oscilloscope** (which uses a CRT for waveform display), the vertical and horizontal deflection sensitivities are independently adjustable to allow for precise control over the display of waveforms.

#### 3.1 **Vertical Sensitivity Control**

The **vertical sensitivity control** adjusts how much the electron beam deflects vertically for a given input signal. This control is typically a knob or dial on the oscilloscope, and it works by adjusting the gain of the **vertical amplifier**. The vertical sensitivity control allows users to:
- **Increase or decrease** the vertical displacement of the waveform on the screen.
- **Zoom in or out** on the vertical axis, allowing for a detailed view of small signal variations or a broader view of the signal’s amplitude.

The vertical sensitivity is typically measured in **volts per division (V/div)**, which defines how many volts correspond to each vertical division on the screen.

#### 3.2 **Horizontal Sensitivity Control**

The **horizontal sensitivity control** adjusts how much the electron beam moves horizontally for a given time interval. It is usually controlled by the **time base generator** and adjusts the rate at which the beam sweeps across the screen. This control allows users to:
- **Increase or decrease** the time duration per horizontal division.
- **Zoom in or out** on the time axis, which helps users to observe the waveform's frequency or fine details of fast events.

The horizontal sensitivity is typically measured in **seconds per division (s/div)**, which defines the time corresponding to each horizontal division on the screen.

---

### 4. **Other Controls in a CRT**

In addition to the vertical and horizontal sensitivity controls, a CRT-based device, such as an oscilloscope, includes several other important controls to adjust the display and signal input.

#### 4.1 **Intensity Control**

The **intensity control** adjusts the brightness of the trace on the screen. It is used to increase or decrease the brightness of the electron beam to make the waveform more visible. This control does not affect the deflection of the electron beam but changes the strength of the electron stream.

#### 4.2 **Focus Control**

The **focus control** adjusts the sharpness of the electron beam. If the beam is too focused, the trace on the screen will appear as a sharp line, while if the focus is poor, the trace will appear blurry or out of focus. This control is crucial for achieving a clear and precise waveform display.

#### 4.3 **Triggering Control**

The **triggering control** ensures that the oscilloscope starts drawing the waveform at the same point in each cycle. This is particularly important when displaying periodic signals, as it prevents the waveform from appearing distorted or unstable. The triggering level can be adjusted to set the point at which the horizontal sweep starts, allowing for stable display of waveforms.

#### 4.4 **Time Base (Sweep) Control**

The **time base control** adjusts the rate at which the horizontal sweep occurs, allowing for proper time scaling. This is essential for measuring the time duration or period of a signal. The time base control is often coupled with the horizontal sensitivity to display the waveform at the appropriate scale.

#### 4.5 **Coupling Control**

The **coupling control** determines how the input signal is coupled to the vertical amplifier. It may have options for:
- **AC coupling**: Blocks any DC component of the signal, allowing only AC signals to pass through.
- **DC coupling**: Allows both AC and DC components to pass through for measurement of the entire signal.
- **Ground**: Disconnects the input signal to measure the baseline or reference level.

---

### 5. **Conclusion**

Deflection sensitivity is a critical factor in the operation of a **Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)**, particularly in devices like **oscilloscopes**. It controls how the electron beam moves in response to the input signal, allowing for accurate display and measurement of waveforms. The **vertical** and **horizontal deflection sensitivity** controls allow users to adjust the display’s amplitude and time scale, respectively, while other controls like **focus**, **intensity**, and **triggering** ensure a stable and clear representation of the signal.

Key Takeaways:
- **Vertical deflection sensitivity** controls the vertical movement of the electron beam based on the input signal's amplitude.
- **Horizontal deflection sensitivity** controls the horizontal sweep based on the time base or signal frequency.
- **Sensitivity controls** (vertical, horizontal) are essential for accurate waveform display.
- Other important controls, such as **intensity**, **focus**, and **triggering**, ensure the proper visualization and measurement of signals.

#### 3.3 **Choosing the Correct Voltage Range**

For accurate voltage measurements, ensure that the voltmeter or multimeter is set to the appropriate voltage range. Most digital multimeters have an **auto-ranging** function that automatically selects the correct range. For analog voltmeters, you may need to manually set the range based on the expected voltage level.

- **Low Range**: For measuring small voltages (e.g., millivolts or low DC voltages).
- **High Range**: For measuring high voltages (e.g., mains AC voltage or high-voltage systems).

---

### 4. **Factors Affecting Voltage Measurement**

#### 4.1 **Input Impedance**

The **input impedance** of the voltmeter refers to the resistance the meter offers to the circuit when it is connected for measurement. Ideally, the voltmeter should have a very high input impedance to minimize its impact on the circuit. A low input impedance would cause the circuit to behave differently when the voltmeter is connected.

- **High Input Impedance**: Ensures that the voltmeter draws minimal current and does not significantly affect the voltage across the circuit.
- **Low Input Impedance**: Can lead to errors in measurement, especially when measuring high-impedance circuits.

#### 4.2 **Loading Effect**

The **loading effect** occurs when the voltmeter, due to its internal impedance, draws current from the circuit and causes a slight voltage drop. This effect is generally small if the voltmeter has a high input impedance, but it can affect measurements, particularly in sensitive circuits.

#### 4.3 **Accuracy and Calibration**

The accuracy of the voltage measurement depends on the precision of the voltmeter or multimeter. Digital voltmeters are typically more accurate than analog ones. It is essential to calibrate the instrument periodically to ensure accurate readings.

---

### 5. **Applications of Voltage Measurement**

Voltage measurement is critical in a wide range of fields and applications:

#### 5.1 **Testing Electronic Circuits**

Measuring voltage at various points in an electronic circuit is essential for troubleshooting and verifying that the circuit is operating correctly. For example, checking the voltage across components like resistors, capacitors, or transistors can help determine if they are functioning as expected.

#### 5.2 **Power Supply Testing**

Voltage measurements are used to verify the output of power supplies. For instance, checking the output voltage of a **DC power supply** or **AC transformer** ensures that the system is providing the correct voltage for powering electronic devices.

#### 5.3 **Signal Monitoring**

In signal testing and communication systems, voltage measurements allow engineers to monitor the strength and quality of signals. This is important in applications like radio frequency (RF) testing, audio equipment, and telecommunications.

#### 5.4 **Battery and Energy Systems**

Voltage measurement is crucial for testing **batteries**, **solar panels**, and other energy systems. By measuring the voltage across a battery or power system, it’s possible to determine its state of charge and overall health.

---

### 6. **Limitations of Voltage Measurement**

#### 6.1 **Range Limitations**

Every voltage measuring device has a maximum voltage range it can measure. Measuring voltages beyond the maximum range can damage the meter or result in inaccurate readings. For high-voltage systems, specialized equipment or safety precautions are required.

#### 6.2 **Measurement Error**

Voltage measurement can be affected by several factors, including:

## Measuring Current, Frequency, and Phase Angle Using CRO

### Introduction to Using a Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)

A **Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)** is an essential tool for visualizing and analyzing electrical signals in terms of **voltage versus time**. While the CRO is primarily used to observe waveforms, it can also be used to measure key electrical parameters such as **current**, **frequency**, and **phase angle**.

In this section, we will discuss how to measure these three parameters using a CRO.

### 1. **Measuring Current Using CRO**

Although a CRO primarily measures voltage, **current measurement** can be accomplished indirectly using the following methods:

#### 1.1 **Using a Current Probe**

A **current probe** is a device that can be connected to the CRO to measure current without directly breaking the circuit. The probe senses the magnetic field created by the current flowing through a conductor and converts it into a corresponding voltage signal. This voltage signal is then fed to the vertical input of the CRO for display.

- **Procedure**:
  1. Attach the current probe around the wire or conductor through which the current is flowing.
  2. The probe will convert the current measurement into a proportional voltage signal.
  3. Display the resulting voltage signal on the CRO screen, and use the known conversion factor (from the probe's specifications) to convert the voltage reading into a current value.

#### 1.2 **Using a Shunt Resistor**

A more traditional method to measure current with a CRO involves inserting a **shunt resistor** in series with the load or circuit. The voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it, according to **Ohm's Law** (V = IR).

- **Procedure**:
  1. Insert a known value of **low-value shunt resistor** (typically in the milliohm to ohm range) in series with the circuit.
  2. Measure the **voltage drop** across the shunt resistor using the CRO.
  3. Use **Ohm's Law** (I = V/R) to calculate the current, where V is the measured voltage and R is the value of the shunt resistor.

#### 1.3 **Direct Measurement in the Vertical Mode**

For small currents, a shunt resistor is usually used with the CRO's vertical deflection to measure the voltage drop directly and convert it into a current reading. This method is highly accurate for low currents.

### 2. **Measuring Frequency Using CRO**

The **frequency** of a signal represents the number of oscillations or cycles per unit time, typically measured in **Hertz (Hz)**. CROs are capable of measuring the frequency of periodic signals by analyzing the time period between cycles.

#### 2.1 **Using the Time Base**

The **time base** or horizontal sweep of the CRO controls how fast the electron beam moves across the screen. The frequency of a signal can be calculated by determining the time period (T) of one complete cycle of the waveform and then using the formula:

**Frequency (f) = 1 / Time Period (T)**

##### **Procedure**:
1. Display the signal waveform on the CRO screen.
2. Adjust the **time base** (horizontal sensitivity) to display one or more complete cycles of the waveform.
3. Measure the **horizontal distance** (in time units, typically in seconds or milliseconds) between two consecutive points of the waveform that correspond to one cycle (e.g., from peak to peak or from zero-crossing to zero-crossing).
4. Calculate the **frequency** using the formula: **f = 1/T**.

#### 2.2 **Frequency Measurement Using the Horizontal Control**

For signals with high frequencies, the **horizontal scale** must be appropriately adjusted so that the waveform fits well within the screen. The **horizontal deflection** control (time/div) lets the user measure the number of cycles within a given time period.

For example, if the time per division is set to 1 ms (millisecond) and two divisions represent one complete cycle of the waveform, then the signal's period is 2 ms, and the frequency would be 500 Hz (f = 1/T = 1/0.002s).

### 3. **Measuring Phase Angle Using CRO**

The **phase angle** between two signals refers to the difference in their timing or phase shift, often expressed in degrees (°). In the context of AC signals, phase differences represent the amount by which one signal leads or lags another signal.

To measure phase angle using a CRO, you need two input signals, and you will analyze the horizontal and vertical deflections of the waveforms.

#### 3.1 **Phase Angle Between Two Signals**

Phase angle is measured by observing the time shift between two signals. The CRO allows you to display both signals simultaneously, and their phase difference can be calculated from the horizontal displacement between corresponding points of the two waveforms.

##### **Procedure**:
1. Connect both signals to the **CRO**: Use **dual input channels** (Channel 1 and Channel 2) for displaying two waveforms.
2. **Align the waveforms**: Use the **triggering control** to stabilize both waveforms on the screen so that they do not drift.
3. Measure the **horizontal displacement** (in time units) between two corresponding points on the waveforms. Common points to measure include:
   - **Zero-crossing points** (the points where the waveform crosses the zero voltage level).
   - **Peak points** (the highest or lowest points of the waveform).
4. Once you have the time difference (Δt) between the two waveforms, calculate the **phase angle** (Φ) using the formula:

   **Phase Angle (Φ) = (Δt / T) × 360°**

   Where:
   - **Δt** is the time difference between corresponding points of the two waveforms (in seconds or milliseconds).
   - **T** is the time period of one cycle of the waveform (in seconds).
   - **360°** is used to convert the time difference into degrees.

#### 3.2 **Using the X-Y Mode of the CRO**

Some oscilloscopes have an **X-Y mode** (also called the Lissajous pattern mode) that can directly measure the phase difference between two signals. In this mode:
- One signal is applied to the **X-axis** (horizontal deflection).
- The other signal is applied to the **Y-axis** (vertical deflection).

If the signals are sinusoidal and have the same frequency, the CRO will display an **ellipse** or other Lissajous patterns. The shape and orientation of the pattern provide a direct measure of the phase angle between the two signals.

- **In-phase signals** (i.e., phase angle of 0°) result in a diagonal line.
- **Out-of-phase signals** will create different patterns that can be used to calculate the phase difference.
