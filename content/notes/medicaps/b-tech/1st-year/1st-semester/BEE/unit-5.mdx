A single line diagram (SLD) for power generation to distribution typically includes the following key components in sequence:

1. **Power Generation (Generating Station)**:
   - Power generation units (e.g., thermal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind turbines)
   - Step-up transformer (to increase voltage for transmission)

2. **Transmission Network**:
   - High voltage transmission lines (e.g., 230 kV, 400 kV)
   - Transmission substations with circuit breakers and isolators
   - Step-down transformers (to reduce voltage for sub-transmission)

3. **Sub-Transmission Network**:
   - Medium voltage lines (e.g., 33 kV, 66 kV)
   - Distribution substations with step-down transformers

4. **Distribution Network**:
   - Primary distribution lines (e.g., 11 kV)
   - Distribution transformers (further reducing voltage to 400 V or 230 V)
   - Secondary distribution lines supplying electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers

**Key Symbols in the SLD**:
- Generator: A circle with a G inside
- Transformer: Two parallel lines with winding notations
- Busbar: Straight line representing connection points
- Circuit Breaker: A simple break in the line with a square box
- Transmission Lines: Simple straight lines

Here's a block diagram representation of **Hydro Power Plant** and **Thermal Power Plant**:

### Hydro Power Plant (Block Diagram)

Water Reservoir → Penstock → Turbine → Generator → Step-up Transformer → Transmission Line


- **Water Reservoir**: Stores water at a height, providing potential energy.
- **Penstock**: A pipeline that directs water from the reservoir to the turbine.
- **Turbine**: Converts kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy.
- **Generator**: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
- **Step-up Transformer**: Increases voltage for efficient transmission.
- **Transmission Line**: Transfers electricity to the grid.

Coal Storage → Boiler → Turbine → Generator → Step-up Transformer → Transmission Line


- **Coal Storage**: Coal is stored for use as fuel.
- **Boiler**: Burns coal to produce steam from water.
- **Turbine**: Steam rotates the turbine, converting thermal energy into mechanical energy.
- **Generator**: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
- **Step-up Transformer**: Increases voltage for transmission efficiency.
- **Transmission Line**: Transfers electricity to the grid.


### **Electrical Installation Components and Concepts**

#### **1. Fuse:**
   - **Purpose:** Protects circuits from overcurrent by melting and breaking the circuit when current exceeds a safe level.
   - **Types:**
     - Rewirable Fuse
     - Cartridge Fuse
     - HRC (High Rupturing Capacity) Fuse
     - Drop-out Fuse

---

#### **2. MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):**
   - **Purpose:** Automatically switches off the circuit during overload or short circuit conditions.
   - **Advantages over Fuse:**
     - Reusable
     - More reliable and faster operation
   - **Types:**
     - Single Pole (SP)
     - Double Pole (DP)
     - Triple Pole (TP)
     - Four Pole (FP)

---

#### **3. Types of Wires and Cables:**
   - **Single Core Wire:** Used in domestic wiring.
   - **Twin Core Wire:** Used for lighting circuits.
   - **Three Core Wire:** Used in three-phase circuits.
   - **Coaxial Cable:** Used for TV signal transmission.
   - **Shielded Cable:** Used in sensitive electronic circuits.
   - **Armoured Cable:** Used for underground wiring for protection.

---

#### **4. Earthing (Grounding):**
   - **Purpose:** Prevent electric shock and protect equipment by providing a path for leakage current.
   - **Types:**
     - Plate Earthing
     - Pipe Earthing
     - Rod Earthing
   - **Components:** Earthing rod/plate, Earthing wire, Moist soil.

---

#### **5. Energy Billing – Sample Calculation:**

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Energy Consumed (kWh)} = \text{Power (kW)} \times \text{Time (hours)}
$$

**Example:**
- Appliance Power: 1.5 kW
- Usage: 5 hours/day
- Days: 30 days
- Tariff Rate: $0.12 per kWh

**Energy Consumed:**
$$
1.5 \times 5 \times 30 = 225 \text{ kWh}
$$

**Energy Cost:**
$$
225 \times 0.12 = \$27
$$
