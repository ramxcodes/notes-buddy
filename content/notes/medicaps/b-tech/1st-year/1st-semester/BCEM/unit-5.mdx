## Introduction of Shear Force and Bending Moment and Their Sign Conventions

### **Definition of Shear Force (SF)**
**Shear Force (SF)** at a section in a beam is the **algebraic sum of all vertical forces** acting on either side of the section. It represents the **internal force** that resists sliding between two sections of the beam.

---

### **Definition of Bending Moment (BM)**
**Bending Moment (BM)** at a section in a beam is the **algebraic sum of moments** of all the forces acting on either side of the section. It represents the **internal moment** that causes the beam to bend.

---

### **Importance of Shear Force and Bending Moment:**
- Essential for **structural analysis**.  
- Helps in **beam design** by determining stress distribution.  
- Critical for **safety** and **load-bearing capacity** evaluation.

- **Cantilever Beam:** Fixed at one end, free at the other.  
- **Overhanging Beam:** Extends beyond the support at one end.  
- **Fixed Beam:** Fixed at both ends.

---

### **Sign Conventions for Shear Force:**

Shear force is considered **positive** or **negative** based on the direction of force:

#### **For a Beam Section:**
- **Positive Shear Force:**  
   - **Upward force** on the left side of the section.  
   - **Downward force** on the right side of the section.  

- **Negative Shear Force:**  
   - **Downward force** on the left side of the section.  
   - **Upward force** on the right side of the section.

### **Sign Conventions for Bending Moment:**

The sign convention for **bending moment** depends on whether the moment causes **sagging** or **hogging**:

- **Positive Bending Moment (Sagging):**  
   - Tension on the **bottom** fibers.  
   - Compression on the **top** fibers.  
   - Beam bends in a **U-shape** (concave up).  

- **Negative Bending Moment (Hogging):**  
   - Tension on the **top** fibers.  
   - Compression on the **bottom** fibers.  
   - Beam bends in an **inverted U-shape** (concave down).

## Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) and Point Moment

---

### **Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)**

### **Definition:**
A **Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)** is a continuous load that is spread evenly along the length of a beam. The load is measured in **force per unit length** (e.g., $$w$$ kN/m).

---

### **Key Characteristics of UDL:**
- Acts **uniformly** over the entire length of the beam segment.  
- Represented as a rectangle on the **Free Body Diagram (FBD)**.  
- Total load is calculated by:  
   $$ W = w \times L $$  
   where:  
   - $$W$$ = Total Load  
   - $$w$$ = Load intensity (force per unit length)  
   - $$L$$ = Length of the beam segment under UDL  

---

### **Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams for UDL on a Simply Supported Beam:**

#### **1. Shear Force Diagram (SFD) for UDL:**
- **Linear variation** throughout the length of the beam.  
- Starts from the maximum reaction at the **left support** and decreases linearly to the right.  

#### **Key Values:**
- At the left support:  
   $$ SF_A = \frac{wL}{2} $$  
- At the right support:  
   $$ SF_B = -\frac{wL}{2} $$  

---

#### **2. Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) for UDL:**
- **Parabolic variation** due to the distributed nature of the load.  
- Maximum bending moment occurs at the center of the beam:  
   $$ M_{max} = \frac{wL^2}{8} $$  
- **Zero moments** at both supports.  


---

## **Point Moment (Concentrated Moment)**

### **Definition:**
A **Point Moment** or **Concentrated Moment** is a moment applied at a specific point on a structural element, typically measured in **kNm**.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Point Moment:**
- Acts at a **single point** rather than across a length.  
- Does not cause vertical forces but affects the **bending moment** distribution.  
- Common in **hinged connections** or where a couple exists.  

---

### **Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams for a Point Moment on a Simply Supported Beam:**

#### **1. Shear Force Diagram (SFD) for Point Moment:**
- **No effect** on the shear force since it does not contribute to vertical loading.  

---

#### **2. Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) for Point Moment:**
- **Instantaneous jump** at the point of the applied moment.  
- The magnitude of the jump equals the applied moment **$$M$$**.  

---

### **Example Calculation for Point Moment:**
- Beam length = $$L$$  
- Point moment $$M$$ applied at midspan.  

#### **Bending Moment:**
- Left side of the point moment: $$M_{left} = M$$.  
- Right side of the point moment: $$M_{right} = M$$.

## **Combined Effect: UDL with Point Moment on a Simply Supported Beam**

When both **UDL** and **Point Moment** are present:

   $$ \frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = -w(x) $$  

**Explanation:**  
- The second derivative of the bending moment is equal to the **negative value** of the load applied.  

---

   $$ V(x) = R_A - w \cdot x $$  
- **Bending Moment:**  
   $$ M(x) = R_A \cdot x - \frac{w \cdot x^2}{2} $$  

---

### **Key Observations:**
