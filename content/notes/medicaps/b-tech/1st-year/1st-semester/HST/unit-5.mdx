## Technology Forecasting
Technology forecasting attempts to predict the future characteristics of useful technological machines, procedures, or techniques. It primarily deals with the characteristics of technology, such as levels of technical performance. For example, predicting the speed of a military aircraft, the power output of an engine, the accuracy of a measuring instrument, or the number of transistors in a chip in 2015.

### Technology Forecasting Methodologies
![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMmWEzSyREAJtbzPhBh74LOhBiZihukrhV8RiFzHgtWv1ooIKB)

Specific techniques for forecasting fall into two main categories: **exploratory** and **normative**.

### Exploratory Techniques

Exploratory techniques focus on analyzing historical data, plotting selected attributes such as functional performance, technical parameters, and economic performance against time. It is generally assumed that progress is evolutionary, and technological progress is not random. From this data, characteristic curves or patterns are generated, and forecasts can be made with varying degrees of certainty. 

However, new or surprise factors should not be disregarded as they may lead to changes in trends.

Examples of relevant exploratory techniques include:
- **S-curves**
- **Trend extrapolation**
- **Technology substitution**

These methods rely on large amounts of statistical data, which may not always be freely available.

### Normative Techniques

Normative techniques start by proposing a desired or possible state, such as the satisfaction of a market need or the achievement of a technological development, and work backward to determine the necessary steps to reach that outcome. 

The number of foreseeable paths to the objective could range from “none,” implying a completely new technology, to “several,” suggesting multiple development paths. Each feasible path is analyzed for its relevance and difficulty.

## Technological Innovation

**Technological innovation** refers to activities that contribute to the research, development, and design of new products, services, or techniques, or to improving existing products, generating new technological knowledge. It is the process of introducing or altering technology (often information technology) within an organization.

Technological innovation improves productivity, quality, and adds value to customers. The process includes the development and diffusion of new products, services, and organizational models within the market and society.

## The 8 Stages of the Technological Innovation Process

### 1. Basic Research

Basic research is typically conducted in large companies, especially in sectors like pharmaceuticals, energy, and IT. It ensures that R&D departments stay updated on state-of-the-art technologies that impact their organization.

### 2. Applied Research

When specific market needs are detected, companies search for technologies that can solve these problems. They might integrate existing technologies creatively or develop entirely new solutions.

### 3. Development

Once a solution is identified, a prototype is developed and tested, preferably with public input, to ensure its viability and market readiness.

### 4. Engineering

At this stage, the prototype is refined to a scalable product or service that can be mass-produced or meet the specific needs of an industry. This involves sourcing materials, hiring professionals, and organizing production logistics.

### 5. Manufacture

Manufacturing is the process of producing the final product. Companies need to determine how to efficiently deliver their solution to customers while maintaining high quality.

### 6. Marketing

Before the product is officially launched, companies perform concept tests, market research, and market testing to ensure that the product meets customer needs and expectations.

### 7. Promotion

After testing, the product or service is launched to the wider market, with national or global promotion depending on the company’s reach.

### 8. Continuous Improvement

Once the product or service is launched, both the product and the processes used to create and deliver it are continuously measured and improved to add further value for customers.
