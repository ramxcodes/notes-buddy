## 1. **Requirement Analysis in Software Development**

**Requirement analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of the stakeholders for a software system. The purpose is to clearly define the problem that the software will solve and ensure all parties involved understand the features, functionalities, and constraints of the system before development begins.

## Importance of Requirement Analysis:

- **Foundation of the Project**: Requirements form the blueprint for the software. If they are unclear or misunderstood, the entire project may be at risk of failure.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency**: Properly gathered and analyzed requirements help avoid costly rework and delays. Misunderstood or incomplete requirements lead to project overruns.
- **Alignment with Stakeholder Expectations**: Ensures the final product matches what stakeholders expect and need. This avoids dissatisfaction after project completion.
- **Reduced Risks**: Requirement analysis helps in identifying potential risks early and establishing the scope of the project, which can prevent scope creep.

## 2. **Stakeholders in Software Development and Their Roles**

Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the outcome of a project. They contribute to the requirement-gathering process in the following ways:

- **Business Analysts**: Bridge the gap between business needs and the technical team. They help define requirements and ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Customers/Clients**: Provide the business perspective by explaining their needs, problems, and expectations from the software.
- **End Users**: The people who will use the software. Their feedback helps define how the system should behave to solve real-world problems.
- **Project Managers**: Oversee the project and ensure it aligns with the agreed requirements, budget, and timeline.
- **Developers and Engineers**: Offer a technical perspective to ensure that the requirements are feasible and can be implemented within the constraints of the technology.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Teams**: Ensure that requirements are testable and measurable. They help design test cases to validate the system against the requirements.
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Ensure the software complies with any industry regulations or legal requirements.
- **Sponsors**: Typically the funding entities. They provide high-level expectations and goals for the project.

## 3. **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements**: These define the specific behavior or functions of the system—what the system should do. They are features that a system must provide to meet the user needs and accomplish specific tasks.
    
    **Examples of Functional Requirements**:
    
    - A user must be able to create, edit, and delete a profile.
    - The system must send an email notification when a new user registers.
    - The system must generate a monthly report of all transactions.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: These define how the system performs a particular function. They are more about the quality of the system and often include constraints or characteristics like performance, security, usability, and scalability.
    
    **Examples of Non-Functional Requirements**:
    
    - The system should load the homepage within 3 seconds under normal conditions.
    - The application should be accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., following WCAG guidelines).
    - The system must support 10,000 concurrent users.
    - Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

## 4. **Common Challenges in Requirement Analysis**

Several challenges can arise during the requirement analysis phase:

- **Ambiguous or Unclear Requirements**: Stakeholders may provide vague or incomplete descriptions, leading to confusion and misinterpretation of what the system is supposed to do.
- **Changing Requirements**: As a project progresses, stakeholders often realize new needs, or external factors change, which can lead to shifting requirements (scope creep).
- **Conflicting Requirements**: Different stakeholders may have conflicting needs, which makes it challenging to arrive at a consensus. For example, marketing might want more features to attract customers, while engineering might want to limit complexity.
- **Difficulty in Prioritization**: With many potential features, it can be difficult for stakeholders to agree on which requirements are most important.
- **Communication Gaps**: Misunderstandings between technical and non-technical stakeholders can lead to gaps in understanding or incorrect assumptions about how the system should behave.
- **Overlooking Non-Functional Requirements**: Stakeholders often focus on what the system should do (functional requirements) but may neglect how it should perform (non-functional requirements), which can lead to poor user experience or system failures.
- **Lack of Stakeholder Involvement**: If stakeholders (such as end-users or customers) are not actively involved, the requirements may not truly reflect their needs.
- **Documenting Requirements**: Poor documentation can lead to misinterpretation or lack of clarity during the later stages of development. Requirements need to be specific, measurable, and testable.

## 2. **Requirement Elicitation Techniques**

**Requirement elicitation techniques** are methods used to gather information from stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints for a software project. These techniques help business analysts and development teams uncover both explicit and implicit requirements to ensure the software system will meet user expectations. Elicitation is critical because stakeholders may not always articulate their needs clearly, or they may have different perspectives. A structured approach ensures comprehensive, accurate, and aligned requirements.

## Importance of Requirement Elicitation:

- **Improved Accuracy**: Ensures that requirements are precise and well-understood.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Helps identify the needs and expectations of different stakeholders, ensuring that their requirements align with the project goals.
- **Minimized Misunderstandings**: Clear and thorough elicitation reduces ambiguities and misunderstandings in requirements.
- **Foundation for Development**: Accurate requirements lay the groundwork for design, development, and testing processes, reducing costly changes later in the project lifecycle.

## 1. **Different Requirement Elicitation Techniques**

Several techniques are used to gather requirements, each suited to different situations:

### a. **Interviews**

Interviews involve direct, one-on-one conversations between the analyst and stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.

- **Advantages**:
    - Provides in-depth information.
    - Allows for personalized interaction and follow-up questions for clarification.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Time-consuming, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved.
    - Stakeholders may struggle to articulate their requirements clearly.

**Example**: Interviewing a department head to understand how the current system fails and what improvements are expected in a new software solution.

### b. **Surveys/Questionnaires**

Surveys are structured sets of questions distributed to a large group of stakeholders to gather information quickly.

- **Advantages**:
    - Efficient for gathering information from a large number of people.
    - Standardized questions ensure consistency.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Responses may lack depth.
    - Requires careful design to avoid ambiguity.

**Example**: Sending a questionnaire to employees to collect feedback on their use of existing software tools.

### c. **Focus Groups**

A focus group involves gathering a small group of stakeholders (e.g., end-users or customers) for a facilitated discussion to elicit collective insights and feedback.

- **Advantages**:
    - Allows for diverse perspectives and interaction between participants.
    - Uncovers both shared and conflicting views among stakeholders.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can be difficult to manage if group dynamics are unbalanced.
    - Might result in groupthink, where participants agree to avoid conflict.

**Example**: Conducting a focus group with sales representatives to gather input on the design of a new customer management system.

### d. **Observation**

Observation involves watching how users interact with the current system or perform their tasks in real-life scenarios, without asking them directly.

- **Advantages**:
    - Reveals actual behavior and workflow that users may not articulate.
    - Highlights inefficiencies, workarounds, or pain points in the current system.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Time-consuming.
    - May lead to "Hawthorne effect" where users change behavior when they know they are being observed.

**Example**: Observing call center operators to understand how they handle customer inquiries and how a new system could improve their workflow.

## 2. **Brainstorming in Requirement Gathering**

**Brainstorming** is a collaborative technique where a group of stakeholders generates ideas or solutions in a free-form discussion without criticism. It's a creative process that encourages participants to express their thoughts and perspectives on the system or feature being developed.

- **How it works in requirement gathering**:
    - Stakeholders and team members gather to share ideas about possible system functionalities or improvements.
    - The goal is to generate a broad set of ideas that can later be refined and evaluated.
    - Brainstorming sessions often lead to innovation and out-of-the-box thinking, which helps discover requirements that might not emerge through more structured techniques.

**Example**: A team brainstorming session for a new e-commerce platform might generate ideas on features such as personalized product recommendations, customer reviews, and payment methods.

**Advantages**:

- Promotes creativity and innovation.
- Helps in exploring a wide range of ideas in a short period of time.

**Disadvantages**:

- Requires skilled facilitation to avoid domination by more vocal participants.
- Initial ideas may be broad and need further refinement.

## 3. **Prototyping in Requirement Elicitation**

**Prototyping** is an iterative process where a preliminary version of the system or feature is created based on the gathered requirements. The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the system and allows stakeholders to interact with it.

- **Role of Prototyping**:
    - **Visualization**: Stakeholders often find it easier to refine and validate requirements when they can see and interact with a prototype rather than just reading about features in a document.
    - **Feedback**: It enables early and continuous feedback from stakeholders, ensuring that their expectations are being met.
    - **Refinement**: Prototyping helps uncover hidden or implicit requirements, as stakeholders realize what they actually need when they interact with the prototype.
    - **Risk Reduction**: Reduces the risk of misunderstandings and wrong assumptions about the system by providing a working model that evolves through iterative feedback.

**Types of Prototyping**:

- **Throwaway Prototyping**: A quick, rough version of the system used to gather feedback, after which the prototype is discarded.
- **Evolutionary Prototyping**: The prototype is built upon and refined over time, gradually evolving into the final system.

**Example**: Developing a prototype for a mobile banking app where users can navigate through menus and screens to provide feedback on the design, functionality, and usability.

**Advantages**:

- Helps in visualizing abstract requirements.
- Reduces misunderstandings and clarifies user expectations.

**Disadvantages**:

- Building a prototype may require significant resources.
- Stakeholders may become attached to the prototype, even if changes are necessary later.

## 3. **Requirement Modeling - Use Cases, Diagrams, and Data Modeling**

### 1. **Use Case in Software Engineering**

A **use case** in software engineering is a description of how users (or "actors") interact with a system to achieve a specific goal. It models functional requirements by capturing the system’s behavior from the user’s perspective, detailing the steps needed to complete a task. Use cases are essential because they translate high-level business requirements into detailed, actionable user interactions that developers can implement.

### **How Use Cases Model Functional Requirements**:

- **Interaction-Centered**: They focus on interactions between the user (or system) and the software to achieve a goal.
- **Goal-Oriented**: Each use case represents a specific functionality or task that the system will support, helping identify all necessary system features.
- **Functional Breakdown**: They break down the system into discrete actions or behaviors, making it easier to understand and implement functional requirements.

### 2. **Structure of a Use Case**

A **use case** typically includes the following components:

- **Use Case Name**: A brief, descriptive name indicating what the use case accomplishes (e.g., "Login to System").
- **Actors**: Entities (usually users or other systems) interacting with the system. Actors can be primary (initiating interaction) or secondary (involved indirectly).
- **Preconditions**: Any conditions or requirements that must be true before the use case begins (e.g., "User must have a valid account").
- **Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario)**: A step-by-step description of the typical interaction between the actor and the system to achieve the desired outcome.
- **Alternative Flows**: Possible variations in the interaction that could lead to different results (e.g., what happens if the user enters an incorrect password).
- **Postconditions**: The state of the system after the use case has been executed (e.g., "User is logged into the system").
- **Extensions/Exceptions**: Special cases or errors that could occur during the interaction, along with the system’s response (e.g., "If network is unavailable, show error message").

**Example Use Case:**

- **Name**: Withdraw Money from ATM
- **Actor**: Bank Customer
- **Precondition**: Customer has a valid ATM card and PIN.
- **Basic Flow**:
    1. Customer inserts ATM card.
    2. System prompts for PIN.
    3. Customer enters valid PIN.
    4. Customer selects “Withdraw Money.”
    5. Customer selects account and amount.
    6. System dispenses money.
- **Alternative Flow**:
    - If customer enters incorrect PIN three times, the card is retained by the machine.
- **Postcondition**: Money is withdrawn, and account balance is updated.

## 3. **Activity Diagrams**

An **activity diagram** is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used to model the dynamic aspects of a system by showing the flow of control or workflow from one activity to another. It is particularly useful in representing complex business processes, system workflows, or sequences of operations.

### **How Activity Diagrams Help in Modeling Flow of Control**:

- **Sequential and Parallel Flows**: They depict both the sequential flow (where one activity follows another) and parallel processes (where multiple activities can occur simultaneously).
- **Decision Points**: They show decision points where the flow may diverge based on conditions (e.g., "if login successful, go to homepage; else, show error").
- **Start and End Points**: Clearly marks where the process begins and ends.
- **Action States**: Represent specific tasks or operations performed within the system.

**Example**: An activity diagram for an order processing system would show steps like receiving the order, checking inventory, processing payment, and shipping the product.

## 4. **Swimlane Diagrams in Activity Diagrams**

**Swimlane diagrams** are a type of activity diagram that divides the diagram into "lanes" (or columns) to represent different roles, departments, or systems responsible for specific activities. Each lane represents a different entity (person or system) involved in the process.

### **How Swimlane Diagrams Represent Responsibilities**:

- **Clear Role Assignment**: They visually differentiate which actor or system is responsible for each action, improving clarity on task ownership.
- **Parallel Processes**: Swimlane diagrams show how various roles or entities work together in parallel or interact at different points in the workflow.
- **Simplified Complex Processes**: By organizing activities into distinct lanes, complex processes can be more easily understood, as responsibilities are clearly defined.

**Example**: In a loan approval process, one swimlane could represent the customer, another for the loan officer, and another for the system performing credit checks.

## 5. **Data Modeling in Software Development**

![image.png](https://img.notionusercontent.com/s3/prod-files-secure%2F2569df28-564b-470f-aafe-abe52b815e0b%2Fb0e39b6d-a372-4f27-82c0-b255c7ea7c8d%2Fimage.png/size/w=1280?exp=1735310695&sig=rv0BrNcgljf-yDDKzbh5o9sxYkOe1k_OlQDrWSBv2Aw)

**Data modeling** is the process of creating a visual representation of the data structures required by a system. It defines how data is stored, organized, and managed. In software development, data modeling is critical because it provides a blueprint for database design, ensuring that the system's data needs are well-defined and optimized.

### **Why Data Modeling is Important**:

- **Efficient Database Design**: Ensures that the database structure supports the functional requirements efficiently.
- **Consistency and Integrity**: Helps maintain consistency, integrity, and quality of data by establishing relationships between entities.
- **Clear Communication**: Provides a clear representation of the data, facilitating communication between developers, database administrators, and stakeholders.

## 6. **Types of Models in Data Modeling**

Data modeling typically involves three main types of models:

1. **Conceptual Data Model**: Provides a high-level overview of the data and its relationships without going into technical details. It focuses on identifying key entities and their relationships.
    - **Example**: An e-commerce system’s conceptual model may include entities like "Customer," "Order," and "Product."
2. **Logical Data Model**: More detailed than the conceptual model, it defines the structure of the data, including attributes and relationships but remains independent of specific database technologies.
    - **Example**: In a logical model, the "Customer" entity may have attributes like "Customer ID," "Name," "Email," and relationships such as "places orders."
3. **Physical Data Model**: Specifies how data will be stored in the database, including tables, columns, data types, and constraints. This model is technology-specific.
    - **Example**: The "Customer" entity becomes a table with fields like "CustomerID (int)," "Name (varchar)," etc.

## 7. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a graphical representation of how data moves through a system. It shows the system’s processes, the data flows between them, and the sources and destinations of data (such as external entities and databases). DFDs are used to model both functional and informational aspects of a system.

### **How DFDs Represent Information Flow**:

- **Processes**: Represented by circles or ovals, indicating actions or transformations on the data.
- **Data Stores**: Represented by rectangles, showing where data is stored.
- **Data Flows**: Represented by arrows, indicating the flow of information between entities, processes, and data stores.
- **External Entities**: Represented by squares, showing entities that interact with the system (e.g., users, other systems).

**Example**: A DFD for a library system may show processes such as "Borrow Book," with data flowing from the "Member" (external entity) to the process and updating the "Library Database" (data store).

## 8. **Differences Between Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 DFDs**

DFDs are hierarchical, with different levels providing varying degrees of detail:

1. **Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)**:
    - **Overview**: Represents the entire system as a single process (also known as a "context diagram"). It shows external entities interacting with the system but does not detail internal processes.
    - **Purpose**: High-level view showing major data flows between the system and external entities.
    - **Example**: A library system DFD might show the process "Manage Library System" with data flows between the "Member" and "Library Database."
2. **Level 1 DFD**:
    - **Breakdown**: Expands the Level 0 DFD by decomposing the system into sub-processes, showing more detail about how data flows within the system.
    - **Purpose**: Illustrates internal processes and data flows, providing more detailed information about how the system operates.
    - **Example**: In the library system, "Manage Library System" might break down into processes like "Borrow Book," "Return Book," and "Search Catalog."
3. **Level 2 DFD**:
    - **Further Detailing**: Provides even more detail by breaking down Level 1 processes into finer sub-processes.
    - **Purpose**: Explains the workings of individual processes in greater detail, useful for complex systems.
    - **Example**: The "Borrow Book" process in the Level 1 DFD might be decomposed into sub-processes like "Check Book Availability" and "Update Member Account."

## 4. **Overview of Class-Based Modeling**

### 1. **Class-Based Modeling in Software Development**

**Class-based modeling** is a fundamental approach in object-oriented software development that focuses on defining the structure and behavior of classes (which represent real-world entities) in the system. It is a method of modeling the static structure of a system by describing objects, their attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. This type of modeling is crucial for understanding how different components of the system interact and how data is encapsulated and managed.

### **Difference Between Class-Based and Functional Modeling**:

- **Class-Based Modeling**:
    - Focuses on **objects**, their properties, and interactions.
    - Models **static structure** (what the system is) by defining **classes**, their attributes (data), methods (functions), and relationships.
    - Suitable for object-oriented development (e.g., using languages like Java, C++, Python).
- **Functional Modeling**:
    - Focuses on **processes** and how the system behaves over time.
    - Models the **dynamic behavior** (what the system does) by defining **functions**, processes, and data flows.
    - Often represented using techniques like Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) or activity diagrams.

In essence, class-based modeling is more about the architecture and static design of the system’s objects, while functional modeling is concerned with the dynamic behavior and workflows.

### 2. **Key Elements of a Class Diagram in Object-Oriented Modeling**

A **class diagram** is the primary tool used in class-based modeling to depict the static structure of a system. It describes how classes are related and how they interact with each other.

### Key Elements of a Class Diagram:

1. **Class**: Represents an entity in the system with attributes and methods.
    - **Attributes**: Characteristics or properties of the class (e.g., in a `Car` class, attributes could include `color`, `make`, and `model`).
    - **Methods/Operations**: Functions or behaviors that the class can perform (e.g., a `Car` might have methods like `start()`, `stop()`, or `accelerate()`).
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Class: Car
    Attributes: color, make, model, speed
    Methods: start(), stop(), accelerate(), brake()
    
    ```
    
2. **Object**: Represents a specific instance of a class. Objects inherit the attributes and behaviors defined by their class.
3. **Attributes and Methods Visibility**: Determines whether attributes or methods are accessible from other classes. Common visibility notations include:
    - **Private (-)**: Attribute/method is accessible only within the class.
    - **Public (+)**: Attribute/method is accessible from outside the class.
    - **Protected (#)**: Attribute/method is accessible within the class and its subclasses.
4. **Relationships**: Represents the connections between different classes:
    - **Association**: A basic relationship where two classes are connected but do not have a strong dependency on one another (e.g., "a student enrolls in a course").
    - **Aggregation**: A relationship where one class is a part of another but can exist independently (e.g., "a department consists of employees").
    - **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation where the contained class cannot exist independently of the container class (e.g., "a house has rooms," where the room cannot exist without the house).
    - **Inheritance**: A relationship where one class (subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass), forming a hierarchy (e.g., "a car is a type of vehicle").
5. **Multiplicity**: Indicates how many instances of one class relate to instances of another class. For example, a 1..* relationship means one instance of the first class can relate to many instances of the second class.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    1 (Manager)  --- 0..* (Employee)
    
    ```
    
6. **Interfaces**: Define a contract that a class must implement. Interfaces represent only the method signatures without implementation.

## 3. **Representation of Relationships in Class-Based Modeling**

Class-based modeling uses different types of relationships to define how classes interact with each other:

### a. **Association**

- **Definition**: Association represents a general relationship between two classes, where one class interacts with or uses another class.
- **Representation in Class Diagram**: It is depicted by a straight line between two classes, often with labels to describe the nature of the association.
- **Multiplicity**: Specifies how many objects of one class are associated with objects of another class (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
    
    **Example**: In a library system, a `Member` class may have an association with a `Book` class, showing that a member can borrow many books.
    
    ```
    Member 1 ------------- * Book
    
    ```
    

### b. **Aggregation**

- **Definition**: Aggregation represents a "whole-part" relationship where one class contains or owns another class, but the part can exist independently of the whole.
- **Representation in Class Diagram**: Represented by a hollow diamond at the "whole" side, connecting to the "part" side.
- **Example**: A `Department` can have many `Employees`, but the employees can exist independently of the department.
    
    ```
    Department <>--- Employee
    
    ```
    

### c. **Composition**

- **Definition**: Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the "part" is tightly bound to the "whole." If the whole is destroyed, the parts also cease to exist.
- **Representation in Class Diagram**: Depicted by a filled (solid) diamond on the side of the "whole."
- **Example**: A `House` contains multiple `Rooms`, but if the house is destroyed, the rooms are also destroyed.
    
    ```
    House ◆--- Room
    
    ```
    

### d. **Inheritance (Generalization)**

- **Definition**: Inheritance (also called generalization) represents an "is-a" relationship, where one class (the child or subclass) inherits the attributes and methods of another class (the parent or superclass).
- **Representation in Class Diagram**: Represented by a solid line with an empty triangle pointing toward the superclass.
- **Example**: A `Car` class may inherit from a `Vehicle` class, meaning a car "is a" type of vehicle.
    
    ```
    Vehicle ▲--- Car
    
    ```
    
    The `Car` class inherits attributes like `speed` and `fuel` from `Vehicle`, and may also define its own specific attributes like `model` or `color`.
    

## 5. **Requirement Tracking**

### 1. **What is Requirement Tracking?**

**Requirement tracking** is the process of monitoring and managing software requirements throughout the development lifecycle. It involves documenting requirements, tracking changes to them, and ensuring that all requirements are addressed in the final product. The goal is to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements and that any changes to those requirements are properly managed.

### **Why Requirement Tracking is Essential for Project Management**:

- **Visibility**: Requirement tracking provides visibility into the status of each requirement, ensuring that stakeholders can monitor progress.
- **Accountability**: Ensures that each requirement is assigned to a responsible party and that it is implemented, tested, and validated.
- **Quality Control**: By ensuring that all requirements are covered and traced, requirement tracking helps avoid missing features or functionality.
- **Change Management**: As requirements evolve, tracking helps manage and assess the impact of changes to ensure they are implemented without disrupting the project.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Helps identify potential risks or issues early by monitoring the status of requirements and flagging any that are incomplete or unclear.
- **Documentation and Compliance**: Provides a record of the requirements and their status, which is crucial for meeting regulatory, contractual, or quality standards.

### 2. **Traceability Matrices in Requirement Tracking**

A **traceability matrix** is a tool used to ensure that each requirement is being fulfilled during the development process. It is a table that maps requirements to corresponding design elements, code modules, and test cases. The traceability matrix helps to track each requirement across different stages of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that every requirement is implemented and validated.

### **How Traceability Matrices Are Used**:

- **Forward Traceability**: Maps requirements to design, development, and testing artifacts. It ensures that all requirements are addressed by the corresponding technical components and test cases.
- **Backward Traceability**: Maps design or testing elements back to their original requirements, ensuring that all elements are justified by a requirement. This prevents "feature creep," where unnecessary features are added without a requirement.
- **Bidirectional Traceability**: Combines both forward and backward traceability to ensure that requirements are covered from the design phase through testing and that every developed feature is linked to a requirement.

### **Typical Elements of a Traceability Matrix**:

- **Requirement ID**: A unique identifier for each requirement.
- **Requirement Description**: A brief description of the requirement.
- **Design/Implementation Elements**: Links to design documents or code modules that address the requirement.
- **Test Cases**: References to test cases that verify the implementation of the requirement.
- **Status**: Current status of the requirement (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed," "Tested").
- **Priority**: The priority level of the requirement, often used to ensure critical requirements are completed first.
- **Change History**: Details of any changes made to the requirement over time.

### **Example of a Traceability Matrix**:

| **Requirement ID** | **Requirement Description** | **Design Element** | **Code Module** | **Test Case ID** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | User login functionality | UI Mockup 1.1 | Login.java | TC001 | Completed |
| R2 | Password reset functionality | UI Mockup 1.2 | ResetPwd.java | TC002 | In Progress |

### 3. **Impact of Changing Requirements on Software Development**

Changes to requirements are common during software development, but they can have a significant impact on the project if not managed properly. Requirements may change due to new stakeholder needs, evolving market conditions, or technical constraints discovered during development.

## **Impact of Changing Requirements**:

- **Increased Costs**: Changing requirements often result in rework, which can increase development costs. Developers may have to modify existing code or redesign components to accommodate new requirements.
- **Delays**: If a requirement changes late in the development process, it can delay the entire project. Changes to code often require additional testing, debugging, and re-validation.
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled or frequent changes to requirements can lead to scope creep, where the project's scope expands beyond its initial boundaries, making it difficult to deliver on time or within budget.
- **Quality Issues**: Without proper tracking, frequent changes can introduce defects, as developers may not fully understand the implications of the new requirements on the system’s architecture or previously implemented features.
- **Risk of Misalignment**: If stakeholders or teams are not aligned when requirements change, the project risks delivering a product that doesn’t meet user needs or business goals.

### 4. **How Requirement Tracking Helps Manage Changing Requirements**

Effective requirement tracking provides a structured approach to managing changes. It ensures that all changes are documented, assessed for impact, and incorporated into the project in a controlled manner.

### **Ways Requirement Tracking Helps Manage Changes**:

- **Change Control Process**: Requirement tracking enables a formal change control process where every change is assessed for its potential impact on the project. This process involves reviewing the change, analyzing its effects on scope, timeline, and cost, and getting approval from stakeholders before implementation.
- **Impact Analysis**: When requirements change, requirement tracking allows teams to trace the change to affected design documents, code modules, and test cases. This helps developers understand the full impact of the change and prevents incomplete or broken implementations.
- **Versioning**: Requirement tracking tools often support version control, which allows teams to manage different versions of the requirements. This ensures that changes are recorded and that previous versions can be referred to if necessary.
- **Prioritization**: Tracking helps project managers prioritize changes. Not all changes are equally important, and a traceability matrix can help identify which requirements are critical and should be addressed first.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Requirement tracking provides a single source of truth for all stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aware of the status of requirements and any changes that occur. This reduces misunderstandings and keeps the project aligned with stakeholder expectations.
- **Test Case Updates**: By linking requirements to test cases in the traceability matrix, requirement tracking ensures that test cases are updated to reflect any changes, which helps maintain the quality of the software and reduces the likelihood of defects.
